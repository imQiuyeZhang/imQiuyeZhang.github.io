            Hello there! I'm Qiuye Zhang, an second-year AI & CS student at the University of Edinburgh. My enthusiasm for computational neuroscience and computational psychiatry runs deep, as I am passionate about understanding the intricacies of our brains and finding ways to address the various diseases that can affect them. As I continue to study, I am constantly training my internal model as well, trying to figure out the “values” of things in my life, and exploring uncertainities.

            Outside of my academic pursuits, I am an ardent fan of the performing arts. I've been delving into dancing, singing, and musical theatre. The adrenaline rush of performing and the sheer joy of expressing myself through various artistic mediums have become an essential part of who I am today.

            My fascination with existentialism, particularly the works of Albert Camus, has had a profound impact on my life. Existentialism as a philosophy grapples with questions about the meaning of existence, individual freedom, and the nature of human consciousness. Camus' emphasis on the absurdity of life and his exploration of how individuals can forge meaning in an inherently chaotic world have resonated with me on a deep level. His masterpiece, "The Stranger," serves as a compelling examination of the human condition, and his ideas have shaped my personal outlook.
