Connecting with Nature Through Open Water Swimming


CZ
I want to wirte a blog. But I feel my current writing is chaotic. Help me sort it out and maybe add a bit more thoughts. I wanted to share some of my thoughts on nature, sports, and wellbeing. 

Yesterday I did my first open water swimming session in my life, and the first day of my life this year without my laptop. Surprisingly, I felt that was easier than pool swimming. I have been very burnt out during my exchange at CMU. And after the exchange ended, I have been suffering from mental tiredness and loss of motivation. I know that is my brain’s adaption to stress. And I am trying to destress myself. 

I started doing more sports and spend more time on meditation. But the heatwave stopped me from spend more time doing outdoor running and cycling. I tried to the indoor equipment. And I found I couldn’t focus on my own body feeling as much as outdoor training. Last month, I decided to set myself a goal, that is to finish an Ironman 70.3 next year. So I started learning swimming. I loved this sport. I love the sound of my arm put into the water and the sound of my breath. The only thing I feel is my body’s interaction with the water. And I feel belong to my body. I think that process is similar to mindfulness. And during the open water swimming, I feel the surround is more quiet, and since I can’t see anything in the water, I can focus better on my body feeling. 

Today I finally feel I am a bit more motivated again.

Consider adding a section about the broader benefits of connecting with nature for mental health and wellbeing, backed by some scientific research if possible.
You might want to conclude with some advice for readers who might be experiencing similar burnout or looking to reconnect with nature and their bodies.

Finding Balance Through Nature and Sport: A Journey of Renewal

Yesterday, I experienced two firsts in my life: my first open water swimming session and my first day this year without my laptop. These seemingly simple events are significant parts of my journey towards recovery from burnout and rediscovering my connection with nature and myself.

My exchange program at CMU had left me mentally exhausted and unmotivated. I recognized this state as my brain's adaptation to prolonged stress, and I knew I needed to take active steps to destress and regain my balance. In search of renewal, I turned to sports and meditation as my primary tools for recovery.

The recent heatwave posed a challenge, forcing me to switch from outdoor running and cycling to indoor equipment. This transition made me realize how much I valued the connection with nature during my workouts. Using indoor equipment, I found it difficult to focus on my body's sensations as I could during outdoor training. 

To reignite my motivation, I set myself an ambitious goal: to complete an Ironman 70.3 next year. This decision led me to explore a new sport - swimming. As I began learning to swim, I fell in love with the sport. The sounds of my arms entering the water and my rhythmic breathing created a meditative atmosphere. In the pool, I found myself fully present, aware of my body's interaction with the water. This immersive experience closely resembled mindfulness practice, allowing me to feel truly connected to my body.

My first open water swimming session was a revelation. Surprisingly, I found it easier and more enjoyable than pool swimming. The quiet surroundings and the inability to see clearly underwater enhanced my focus on bodily sensations. This experience deepened my connection with myself and nature in a way I hadn't anticipated.

In the water, the only thing I feel is my body's interaction with the surrounding element. I feel a sense of belonging to my body that I hadn't experienced in a long time. During open water swimming, the surroundings feel more serene, and since visibility is limited, I can focus better on my body's sensations.

This journey through nature and sport has not only helped me combat burnout but also reconnected me with my body and the world around me. Today, I feel a spark of motivation returning. As I continue this path, I look forward to more open water swims, further training for the Ironman 70.3, and maintaining this newfound balance between technology, nature, and personal wellbeing.

Whether it's swimming in open water, running through a forest, or cycling along a scenic route, these activities offer more than just physical benefits. They provide a way to reconnect with ourselves, quiet our minds, and find balance in our increasingly hectic lives. I've realized that true wellbeing comes not just from achieving our goals, but from the journey itself - the daily practices that ground us and remind us of our place in the natural world. For anyone feeling burnt out or disconnected, I encourage you to find your own path back to nature. It might just lead you to a renewed sense of self and purpose.
