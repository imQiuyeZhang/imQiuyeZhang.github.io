        <h2>Reflection on my mental health and self-care </h2>
        <time datetime="2023-04-21T23:06">April 22, 2023, 2:30 PM</time>
        <p>
            <img src="image/blog1/01.jpeg" alt="" class="float-right">
            Today, I took my first day off this year, allowing me the opportunity to reflect on my mental health. As a student fascinated by computational psychiatry, I explore the alterations in our internal models when faced with illness and understand that stress is linked to numerous psychiatric disorders. Yet, I find myself in a constant state of stress and frustration. I reassure myself that it's okay, but in reality, it's not.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the year, I've neglected to give myself any breaks. There always seems to be more to learn and an endless list of tasks to accomplish, so I never pause. This relentless pressure has taken a significant toll on my mental well-being.
        </p>

            My studies have enlightened me about the influence of stress on our internal models and the connections between various diseases and emotional distress. However, when I'm overwhelmed, I still tell myself, "It's okay. Just get through this semester." I turn a blind eye to my own fragile mental state and press on under the mounting pressure.
            
        </p>
        <p>
            This raises the question: How can I help others struggling with mental health issues if I can't manage my own? Identifying the root causes of mental health problems is essential and it is my ultimate goal. However, this alone cannot negate the pressure and pain inflicted by society.
        </p>

            I've immersed myself in articles and models, becoming familiar with the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches. Yet, I acknowledge that I haven't taken any concrete steps towards enhancing my own well-being. What about those who don't know what could help them? Or those who might be aware of the potential benefits of therapy but remain skeptical of its effectiveness?
            
            <div class="clearfix"></div>

        </p>
        <p>
            This realization prompted me to pause and subsequently resolve to persevere. I do not have all the answers or be capable of making a significant impact just yet, but I will carry on as long as hope remains.
