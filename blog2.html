            A month ago, under the weight of tremendous stress, I turned to running as a form of solace. To ensure that I stayed committed to this journey, I enrolled myself in the Edinburgh Half Marathon.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey began on April 25th with a modest 3km run - an endeavor filled with uncertainty, exhilaration, and a sense of accomplishment. Fast forward to yesterday, I realized a personal triumph: I completed my first half marathon, covering a challenging distance of 21.08km in 2:02:13.
        </p>

            As I traversed the halfway mark of my run, an empowering realization struck me: I chose to christen this journey as my 'new run'. The idea of running long distances was an alien concept to me until yesterday. Yet, there I was, on a profound exploration of my physical capabilities and pushing the limits of what I thought was possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            This marathon journey has been about much more than running. It's been seven years since I last took running seriously. Those years have been a tumultuous roller-coaster ride, marked by a fierce battle against a chronic illness, enduring numerous emotional upheavals, and confronting life's daunting challenges head-on.
        </p>

            During this journey, 'Neuron' has held a special place in my heart. As a symbol of my unwavering academic pursuit, it's been a beacon of hope that has guided me through the darkest times.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am fortunate to have recovered from my illness, but the post-recovery phase has been a struggle, trying to rebuild my life after such a formidable adversary. But with determination, perseverance, and resilience, I've bravely continued chasing the life I desire.
        </p>
        <p>
            Approaching the finish line of the half marathon, a surge of emotions washed over me. On the brink of tears, I felt a profound sense of pride in my resilience and courage. Running this half marathon has proved to me that the disease did not - and will not - defeat me. It has shown me that I am not only strong enough to embrace life's challenges but also to live life on my terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'new run' signifies my resolve to move forward, embracing the promise of new beginnings, and facing the future with strength and optimism. The Edinburgh Half Marathon was a pivotal step on this journey, marking not just a personal achievement, but a victory over my past challenges and a beacon for a brighter, bolder future.
        </p>
        <p>
            And so, the 'new run' continues...
