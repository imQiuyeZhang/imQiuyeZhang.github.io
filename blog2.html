            A month ago, amid stress and searching for a refuge, I found solace in running. To affirm my commitment to this newfound path, I registered for the Edinburgh Half Marathon.
        </p>
        <p>
            My journey began on April 25th with a modest 3km run. Fast forward to yesterday, I realized a personal triumph: I completed my first half marathon, covering a challenging distance of 21.08km in just over two hours.

            As I hit the midway point of my run, an empowering thought crossed my mind: this is my 'new run'. It marked a profound exploration of my physical capabilities, pushing the limits of what I thought possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            'Neuron' has held a special place in my heart throughout these trials, representing my unwavering academic pursuits.

            I am blessed to have recovered from my illness. Despite all hardships, I've bravely continued in my pursuit of the life I desire.
        </p>
        <p>
            As I approached the finish line of the half marathon, a surge of emotions washed over me. I proved to myself that I was not defeated by the disease; I was strong enough to embrace life's challenges and to live life on my terms.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 'new run' signifies my resolve to move forward, to embrace the promise of new beginnings, and to face the future with strength and optimism.
